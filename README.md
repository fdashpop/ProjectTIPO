# ProjectTIPO
Trash In Product Out

Project TIPO is an offspring of the Fab Labs movement and the Fab City Initiative.
The goal of TIPO is to start a local circular economy initiative where Fab Labs collect and redistribute residual material from local industry and commercial operations.

At the moment, the project is prototyping an Alpha release at the Fab Lab du Musée de l'Ingréniosité J.A. Bombardier in Valcourt, Canada.

Our goal is to expand Project TIPO over the next few months. This GIT is maintaine by Marco.
