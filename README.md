# ProjectTIPO
Trash In Product Out

Project TIPO is an offspring of the Fab Lab's movement and the Fab City Initiative.
The goal of TIPO is to start a local circular economy initiative where Fab Labs collect and redistribute residual material from local industry and commercial operations.

At the moment, the project is prototyping an Alpha release at the Fab Lab du Musée de l'Ingéniosité J.A. Bombardier in Valcourt, Canada.

Our goal is to expand Project TIPO over the next few months. This GIT is maintained by Marco. 

# H1 Why Project TIPO

Most people going to a Fab Lab will need some kind of material to work with. Fab Labs produce large amounts of refuse. Industry and commerce send tons of material to the landfill. In many labs, giving away free material to work with is an important incentive to use machines in order to experiment. Doing so lower the financial entry barrier to the Fab Lab and offer people with less access to material, like teens, a fertile ground for innovation.

# H1 How Project TIPO Works

Our initial goal is to gather material from partner industry or commerce before it reaches the curb and divert it to a local Fab Lab. There it is organized and inventoried. The Lab offers to the local user and larger regional Fab Lab community it's reclaimed material. Parterner organizations notify the Lab when refuses should be picked up. The Labs and users commit themselves not to resell material acquired through TIPO and to respect trademarks and partner conditions.
